        "probabilistic inference modules which can be found at " \
        "https://github.com/hbuschme/PRIMO. This reimplementation " \
        "follows the same general idea, but restructured and unified the " \
        "underlying datatypes to allow a more concise API and more efficient " \
        "manipulation, e.g. by the inference algorithm. In turn the inference " \
        "algorithms have been rewritten and partly extended. For most if not " \
        "all use cases this implementation should be easier to use and more " \
        "performant than the original.",
