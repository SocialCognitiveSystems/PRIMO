# PRIMO - PRobabilistic Inference MOdules

This project is a (partial) reimplementation of the original probabilistic inference modules (see branch primo-legacy). This reimplementation follows the same general idea, but restructured and unified the underlying datatypes to allow a more concise API and more efficient manipulation, e.g., by the inference algorithm. In turn the inference algorithms have been rewritten and partly extended. For most if not all use cases this implementation should be easier to use and more performant than the original.
