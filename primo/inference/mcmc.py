    if the product of each variable and the variables in it's  markov blanket
    can be computed in closed form. This is currently only the case for discrete
    variables / ProbabilityTables, but could possibly extended to the continuous
    setting by assuming gaussian forms for the products or using only classes of
    pdfs for which closed forms are computable.

    If the pdf-classes used can not offer this kind of computation you should
    use the MetropolisHastingsTransitionModel, as it only requires to compute
    a single probability, which can way easier be obtained.
